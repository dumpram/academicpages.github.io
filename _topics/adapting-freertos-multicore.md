## Project goal

The goal of the procject is to do a comprehensive research in the area of scheduling
on uniprocessors and multiprocessor real-time systems. Study the principles of real-time
operating systems. Practical implementation has to enable and contain:

* multiprocessor task scheduling, 
* userspace library for application tasks synchronization,
* practical examples that show functionalities of developed port, 
* scalability for greater number of processors.

## Requirements

Requirements:

* C
* microcontroller programming
