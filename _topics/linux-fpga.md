## Project goal

Goal of the project is to develop userspace libraries and device drivers 
for communication with custom IP blocks on FPGA hardware for digital 
signal processing. Developed tools have to enable user to transfer data 
between PS (Processing System) and PL (Programmable Logic) of the 
device (Xilinx Zynq UltraScale is suggested device). Additional tasks 
include:

* research of tools for digital design,
* reserach of AXI perihperal bus,
* research of existing tools for PS/PL interface through AXI bus,
* demonstrate functionalities of developed tools on practical examples.

## Requirements

Requirements:

* C 
* Embedded Linux
* VHDL, Verilog
