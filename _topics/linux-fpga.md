## Project goal

Goal of the project is develop userspace libraries and device drivers 
for communication with custom IP blocks on FPGA hardware for digital 
signal processing. Developed tools have to enable user to transfer data 
between PS (Processing system) and PL (Programmable Logic) parts of the 
device. Additional tasks are:

* research of existing tools,
* determine MPSoC platform with FPGA for testing (ZCU102 is suggested),
* demonstrate functionalities of developed tools on practical examples.

## Requirements

Requirements:

* C 
* Embedded Linux
* VHDL, Verilog
