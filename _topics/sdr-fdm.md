## Project goal

The goal of the procject is to implement communication system based on FDM. Both, transmitter
and receiver have to be implemented. It is necessary to test implementations on real hardware
Implementations have to be suitable for embedded systems (read as: final implementation should
not be in MATLAB, but test implementations and models can be).
Tasks include:

* channel estimation and compensation, 
* detecting start of symbol by various techniques,
* practical examples that show functionalities of developed systems, 
* measuring bandwith and speed of devised communication system,
* providing upper bound on speed and bandwith on some hardware.

## Requirements

Requirements:

* C, MATLAB
* microcontroller programming, digital signal processing
