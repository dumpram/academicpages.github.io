I'm PhD student on Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, University of Zagreb. 
This site contains projects, publications and information about my research work.

# Research area

My main research area is _real-time scheduling in mixed-criticality systems_.
This includes embedded real-time systems and applications. However, I am 
interested in other research areas:

* digital signal processing,
* compressive sensing,
* machine learning.
